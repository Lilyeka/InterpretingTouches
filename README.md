# InterpretingTouches

On the UIViewController view I've add two objects:

DraggedView class object - the view follow the userâ€™s finger
DraggedOneDirectionView class object - the view can be dragged only vertically or horizontally

UIViewController itself implements UIResponder methods for detect if touch is long or short and if it is double touch or single touch.
